# Calgary Community Crime Statistics
## Introduction
The final project is for the courses "Statistical Modelling with Data" and "Working with Data at Scale" at the University of Calgary. The project included two reports for each course respectively.  This project focuses on the crime statistics of Calgary's communities from 2018 to 2023, aiming to discover the underlying patterns and trends with spatial and economic factors.  The main tools used are R, Python, and SQL.

## Dataset
The dataset is from the City of Calgaryâ€™s Open Data Portal

## Calgary_community_Crime_Statistics 

The flies "Calgary_community_Crime_Statistics.ipynb" and "Calgary_community_Crime_Statistics.pdf" are code and report to analyze the crime Statistic. You can check the specific codes and csvs in the folder "sql" if you want to run it.
In this subproject, I developed API endpoints, executed data wrangling and cleaning, managed sizable data(over 3 million rows) imports into MySQL, configured databases, and Drew the ER and normalized datasets. Created SQL views, ran advanced queries, and visualized findings.

## Multiple_Linear_Regression_Analysis_Calgary_Community_Crime_Rate

The files "Multiple_Linear_Regression_Analysis_Calgary_Community_Crime_Rate.pdf" and same name file but in the format of ".Rmd" are the report and R code of the modelling(same topic as the above project). This analysis is based on the data generated by the above project. The folder "R" inclued the data used for modelling.

In this subproject, I utilized R for multiple linear regression analysis, applied statistical methods for model building, tested assumptions, forecasted outcomes, and documented using LaTeX.
